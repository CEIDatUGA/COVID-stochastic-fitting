## The Model 

### Model Overview

This model tracks susceptibles, pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, symptomatic, diagnosed, hopspitalized, dead and recovered hosts. 
The following compartments are included:  

* **S** - uninfected and susceptible individuals 
* **E** - individuals who are infected and do not yet show symptoms. Those individuals can be infectious.
* **I~a~** - individuals who are infected and do not show symptoms. Those individuals are likely infectious, but the model allows to adjust this.
* **I~su~** - individuals who are infected and show symptoms. Those individuals are likely infectious. Individuals in this compartment never get diagnosed and recover.
* **I~sd~** - individuals who are infected and show symptoms. Those individuals are likely infectious. Individuals in this compartment will get diagnosed and move to **C**.
* **C** - individuals who have been diagnosed as cases. Those individuals are likely isolated and not infectious, but the model allows to adjust this.
* **H** - individuals who have been hospitalized. Those individuals are likely isolated and not infectious, but the model allows to adjust this.
* **R** - recovered/removed individuals. Those individuals have recovered and are immune. 
* **D** - individuals who died from the infection. 

To allow more realistic distributions of movement through compartments, several of these compartments are internally split into dummy stages. Dummy stages are currently:

* **E** - 4 compartments
* **I~a~** - 4 compartments 
* **I~su~** - 4 compartments
* **I~sd~** - 4 compartments
* **C** - 4 compartments
* **H** - 4 compartments


The included processes/mechanisms are the following:

* Susceptible individuals ($S$`) can become infected by individuals in the $E$, $I_a$, $I_s$, $I_d$, $C$, and $H$ stages. Rates of transmission from these stages can be adjusted individually.
* All infected hosts first enter the presymptomatic stage and move through the $E$ dummy compartments. At the end of the $E$ stage, a fraction moves into the $I_a$ stage, another fraction moves into the $I_{su}$ stage,  the remainder into the $I_{sd}$ stage.
* Individuals in the asymptomatic $I_a$ stage are assumed to never be diagnosed and eventually recover.
* Individuals in the symptomatic $I_{su}$ stage are assumed to remain undiagnosed and eventually recover.
* Individuals in the symptomatic $I_{sd}$ stage are assumed to be diagnosed after some time and move into the $C$ stage.
* A fraction of individuals in the $C$ stage will naturally recover, without the need for hospitalization. The remainder moves into the $H$ stage.
* A fraction of individuals in the $H$ stage will recover, the remainder dies.

### Interventions

The following interventions are implemented:

* Social distancing, is assumed to reduce all transmission rates by some factor. This is provided as covariate based on mobility data.
* Increased speed of detection, which is assumed to increase at a sigmoidal manner up to a maximum value.
* Increased level of detection, which is assumed to increase the fraction of symptomatic individuals that move into the $I_{sd}$ compartment and will eventually be diagnosed. It is assumed to increase at a sigmoidal manner up to a maximum value.
